// JUMP STATEMENTS OR CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS IN JS

// 1. BREAK :
//  The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely
//  when a certain condition is met. It is commonly used to 
//  terminate a loop early, preventing further iterations.

// 2. CONTINUE :
//  The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of
//  a loop and proceed to the next iteration. It allows you to skip
//  over specific values or conditions without terminating the loop entirely.
